# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

Maria and her supervisor has been asked to assist them with a dilemma that __Py City School__ is facing with the results of the standardized tests results.  From all appearances there seems to be evidence of grade dishonesty for grades in math and reading for __Thomas High School__. This is significant because standardize test grades are important for the decision making process for student funding such as budget priorities and making other strategic decisions on a school and district level. 
Maria has been instructed to replace the test scores for math and reading, specifically for the 9th grade. She is then asked to analyse how this impacts the overall results of all the school districts as a whole and how Thomas High school stacks up agains other schools in the district after the change. Below we will review the results first the performance with out the removal of the "suspect" score and the refactored results, that is after the removal of the scores for the 9th graders.

## Results:

###### Analysis of District Summary

In an overview of the __District Summary__  we observe that the overall passing percentage had a very slight decrease, before the scores were removed it was __65.17__ and after the refactored score is __64.90__.  This is influenced by the expected decreases in in the percentage passing reading which fell from __85.80__ to __85.70__; in math the percentage fell from __74.98 to 74.80__.

###### Analysis of Top Performing Schools

Dispite the removal of 9th grade math and reading scores __Thomas High School__ remained the __second highest__ top performing school before removal of the math and reading scores their overal percentage was __90.95__, which then fell to __90.63__. This left them behind the top performing school __Cabrea High School at 91.34__ and just infront of the third highest performing school __Griffin High School at 90.59__.  It is noted that all three of these schools are 'Chartered Schools'.
