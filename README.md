# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

Maria and her supervisor has been asked to assist them with a dilemma that __Py City School__ is facing with the results of the standardized tests results.  From all appearances there seems to be evidence of grade dishonesty for grades in math and reading for __Thomas High School__. This is significant because standardize test grades are important for the decision making process for student funding such as budget priorities and making other strategic decisions on a school and district level. 
Maria has been instructed to replace the test scores for math and reading, specifically for the 9th grade. She is then asked to analyse how this impacts the overall results of all the school districts as a whole and how Thomas High school stacks up agains other schools in the district after the change. Below we will review the results first the performance with out the removal of the "suspect" score and the refactored results, that is after the removal of the scores for the 9th graders.
